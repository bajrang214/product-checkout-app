## 📄 File Structure

product-checkout-app/
├── index.html      # Main HTML layout
├── style.css       # Styling
└── script.js       # Application logic

• Product data is hardcoded in the script file.
• Product IDs must be entered exactly (case-insensitive) to add to cart.
• No backend or storage — the data resets on page reload
